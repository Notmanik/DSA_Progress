## DSA_Progress
 This repository is dedicated to my personal learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Here, you will find:      
 Topic-based Organization: Each topic (e.g., linked lists, arrays, stacks) has its own directory, with subdirectories for different variations (such as single vs. double linked lists).     
 Code and Explanations: Within each folder, you'll find code implementations along with documentation and notes that explain the core concepts and my thought process.     
 Learning & Experimentation: This is a space for experimentation. I occasionally create separate branches for trying out new approaches or experimenting with advanced techniques.

# Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly)
- Dynamic Programming (LCS, Knapsack)
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Trie)
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
