## 1 Problem: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) (memo_prob_1.cpp)

# Description
Given two strings, the goal is to determine the length of their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).  
A common subsequence is a sequence that appears in both strings in the same relative order but not necessarily consecutively.

# Approach: Memoization (Top-Down)
- **Method**: Recursive approach with caching.
- **Idea**: We recursively explore the solution space, caching intermediate results in a 2D vector (`dp`) to avoid redundant calculations.
